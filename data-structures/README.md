## Assignment1.
### Task 0
Python function that prints all integers of a list, one per line.

Without importing modules or casting integers into strings.

### Task 1
Python function that retrieves an element from a list.

If idx is negative or out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), the function
returns None.

Without importing modules or using try/except.

### Task 2
Python function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

If idx is negative or out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), the function
returns the original list.

Without importing modules or using try/except.

### Task 3
Python function that adds two tuples.

Returns a tuple with two integers:

o The first element is the addition of the first element of each argument.

o The second element is the addition of the second element of each argument.

If a tuple is smaller than 2, the value 0 is used for the missing integer.

If a tuple is larger than 2, only the first two integers are used.

Without importing modules.

### Task 4
Python function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

If the string is empty, the first character should equal None.

Without importing modules.

### Task 5
Python function that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.

If idx is negative or out of range (greater than the number of elements in my_list), the function
returns the original list.

Without imporitng modules or using pop().

### Task 6
Python function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

Without importing modules.

### Task 7
Python function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

Without importing modules.

### Task 8
Python function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Without importing modules.

### Task 9
Python function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

The function assumes all keys are strings.

Keys are printed in alphabetic order.

Keys are only sorted on the first level.

Dictionary values can have any type.

Without importing modules.

### Task 10
Python function that replaces or adds key/value pairs in a dictionary.

The parameter key is always a string.

The parameter value is any type.

If a key exists in the dictionary, the value is replaced.

If a key does not exist in the dictionary, it is created.

Without importing modules.

### Task 11
Python function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

The paramter key is always a string.

If the key does not exist, the dictionary does not change.

Without importing modules.

### Task 12
Python function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.

If the value does not exists, the dictionary is not changed.

All keys having the searched value are deleted.

Without importing modules.

### Task 13
Python function that returns a key value with the biggest integer value.

The function assumes all values are integers.

The function assumes all students have a different score.

If no score is found, the function returns None.

Without importing modules.
